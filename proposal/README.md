# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

StudyBuddy

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows you to upload your study documents for specific classes and to view the study guides of other people.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will allow students to upload their documents from their computer and into a database that can be queried for specific classes. Users will be able to search for the class and view the available classes, and then click on a class to see the study guides posted within. They can then download study guides of their choosing and then upvote or downvote a specific study guide based on its effectiveness.
Users will also be able to comment on study guides
There will also be a list of gut classes offered at Yale that users will also be able to upvote or downvote.
Each user can only upvote or downvote one study guide once
The users will also be able to view a leaderboard of the users with the most points (each upvote=1 point) to see who makes the most reliable study guides
Everyone has to have an @yale.edu email address to join, ensuring that all users are Yale students reviewing study guides


## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website that allows users to log in, upload documents, and view the uploads of others. It will be organized by department and by class. We will be sure to have clean visuals and an easy-to-use interface for our users!


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to what we included above, a better outcome would be to create an upvote system where every upvote adds a “point” to the uploader’s account. There could be a leaderboard of the top 25 students who get the most upvotes, creating a system of trust for content accuracy.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to the Good and Better outcomes, the best outcome would allow users to upvote study guides based on how helpful they are, filling out a short Google Forms (or built-in-website) survey of which the uploader can view the results and visualize how they could improve. We would also love allow comments for our website. In the best case scenario, we also have a page with a similar upvote-downvote system but regarding gut classes.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to figure out how to upload and download documents from a website and store them in a SQL database. We will need to create a leaderboard based on the upvotes and downvotes that is also stored in a SQL database. We will potentially get in contact with Silliman Acorn for rewards program. We must also be conscientious about the design of our project
We will all be working on the entire project together but each person will be in charge of something over break. Kelly will work on the upvote downvote system and the account leaderboard and study guide leaderboard. Raime will work on making the interface friendly, graphics, and login information to ensure only Yale students can register and to keep track of users in the database and their information. Spencer will work on the uploading of documents and creating a friendly interface that allows the uploading and downloading of pages.
