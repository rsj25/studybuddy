# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to make a website that would keep track of helpful academic information for Yalies. It would recommend coffee shops/ study spaces, give class recommendations based on interest/ difficulty level, and have a space to upload study guides.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Kelly Wei (Alden Tan and Christie Yu)
Spencer Strelsov (Philena Sun and Johan Todi)

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No
